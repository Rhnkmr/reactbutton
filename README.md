So Hey what is up! I am using react.js and basically js for the first time and figuring it out. I like JSX a lot cuz its just html but fancy. 
So to run this code u first download the package.
Then go to terminal and find that package. 
Now "npm start" that boy up
That should now open up a localhost on ur browser that shows two buttons!
